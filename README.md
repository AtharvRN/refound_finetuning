## Finetuning RETFound (A foundation model for retinal imaging) for detecting disease related features in OCT Scans

Code for finetuning retfound as single task/multi task feature detection <br/>
Refer to [RETFound: a foundation model for generalizable disease detection from retinal images](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06555-x) to get model file and installation instructions <br/>

Refer to [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/11/12/1186#:~:text=As%20RETFound%20is%20a%20foundational,representations%20for%20automated%20disease%20detection.) to more info regarding dataset, methodology and results <br/>
Refer to [this slide](Retfound.pdf) for more info regarding Foundational Models in OCT and also Artificial OCT Generation using Latent Diffusion Models <br/>
Refer to [this slide](Synthesis.pdf) for some results on Artificial OCT Generation using Pix2Pix GAN and Retfound based GAN <br/>
